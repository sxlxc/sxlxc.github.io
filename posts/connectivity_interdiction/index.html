        As a natural generalization of min-cut, the following problem seems
interesting to me,
<div id="prob1" class="theorem-environment Problem" data-index="1" type="Problem">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">1</span></span>
<p></p>
Given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> and an
integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, find the minimum edge
set whose removal breaks <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-vertex
connectivity?
</div>
<p></p>
Alternatively, one can consider a closely related version of <a href="#prob1" title="Problem 1">Problem 1</a>,

<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">2</span></span>

Given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> and an
integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, find an edge set <span class="math inline">\(F\subset E\)</span> with size at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> whose removal minimizes the vertex

<p></p>
This problem can be called the “vertex connectivity interdiction”. One
can also consider the “algebraic connectivity interdiction” (the second
smallest eigen value of the Laplacian matrix).
<blockquote>
<p></p>
In fact, I think <a href="#prob2" title="Problem 2">Problem 2</a> is not
well motivated. I am interested in it since there may be connections
between breaking vertex connectivity and breaking combinatorial
rigidity. However, it seems strange to consider interdiction problems on
<strong>edge</strong> set for <strong>vertex</strong> connectivity. For
vertex removal, this problem is easy (by splitting vertex and finding
mincut).

<h1 data-number="1" id="checking-k-vertex-connectivity"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Checking <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-vertex connectivity</h1>
<p></p>
Checking if a given graph is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-vertex connected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-vertex-connected_graph#Computational_complexity">can
be done in polynomial time</a>. By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger%27s_theorem">Menger’s
theorem</a> we need to check if for every vertex pair <span class="math inline">\((s,t)\)</span> there are at least <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vertex disjoint paths (excluding <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) connecting <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The number of vertex disjoint paths
between <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can be easily computed through max
flow.
<!-- Duplicate every vertex except $s$ and $t$ and connect an directed edge with capacity 1 between every pair of new vertices. The capacity is 1 for all edges.  -->
We replace every internal vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>
with two copies <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{out}\)</span> and add directed edges from <span class="math inline">\(N(v)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> and from <span class="math inline">\(v_{out}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(N(v)\)</span> with capacity 1. The integral max
flow is the number of internally disjoint paths between <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Since the constraint matrix of flow
problems is TU, maximizing the flow gives us the vertex connectivity.
<blockquote>
<p></p>
Instead of computing the flow for every pair, if we want one flow that
gets the demand for every vertex pair <span class="math inline">\((i&lt;j)\)</span>, the problem becomes much
harder. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem">Multi-commodity

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="minimum-cut-for-edge-connectivity"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Minimum cut for edge
connectivity</h2>
<p></p>
Finding the minimum edge set whose removal breaks the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-edge connectivity is “easy”. It is
known that the global min-cut is the edge connectivity number. <del>Thus
we can simply compute the min-cut and remove any number of the edges as
needed.</del> — which is not true! For unit edge weights this problem is
indeed that easy. However, for general weights edge-connectivity cut is
not as easy as min-cut. This problem is actually the unit cost version
of connectivity interdiction. See next section for more details.
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="minimum-cut-for-vertex-connectivity"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Minimum cut for vertex
connectivity</h2>
<p></p>
With the knowledge of how to compute vertex connectivity, we try to
compute the minimum cut for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-vertex connectivity in a similar way.
First we can find the vertex pair <span class="math inline">\((s,t)\)</span> with the smallest number of
internally disjoint paths. Note that we are dealing with the modified
graph when computing the vertex connectivity number with flow. Hence the
min-cut may contain edges that are not in the original graph, i.e., the
edges connecting <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{out}\)</span>. For example, consider a graph
where every edge has multiplicities 2. The min-cut reported by the flow
algorithm should only contain edges between <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{out}\)</span>.
<p></p>
There is a <a href="https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/egres/open/Node-connectivity">list</a> of
open problems on vertex(node) connectivity. I guess <a href="#prob1" title="Problem 1">Problem 1</a> is NP-hard but cannot prove it. However,
the capacitated version of <a href="#prob2" title="Problem 2">Problem
2</a> and <a href="#prob1" title="Problem 1">Problem 1</a> is hard.
Given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> and edge
weights <span class="math inline">\(w:E\to \Z_{\geq 0}\)</span> and
costs <span class="math inline">\(c:E\to \Z_{\geq 0}\)</span> and a
budget <span class="math inline">\(b\geq 0\)</span>, find edge set <span class="math inline">\(F\subset E\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(c(F)\leq b\)</span> and such that removing <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> minimizes the vertex connectivity of
<span class="math inline">\(G-F\)</span>. Similar to the edge
connectivity case (which will be shown in the next section), if the cost
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is nontrivial then kanpsack is a
special case of this problem. (Consider <span class="math inline">\(G=K_n\)</span> for some large <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Pick a <span class="math inline">\(K_{n-1}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and set the cost of edges in <span class="math inline">\(K_{n-1}\)</span> to infinity.) How hard is <a href="#prob2" title="Problem 2">Problem 2</a> if costs are trivial?
<h1 data-number="2" id="edge-connectivity-interdiction"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> (Edge) Connectivity
interdiction</h1>
<p></p>
If we replace the vertex connectivity in <a href="#prob2" title="Problem 2">Problem 2</a> with edge connectivity, then the problem
is called connectivity interdiction and was first studied by Zenklusen
<span class="citation" data-cites="zenklusen_connectivity_2014">[<a href="#ref-zenklusen_connectivity_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>.

<p></p>
Given a graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> and costs
<span class="math inline">\(c:E\to \Z_+\)</span> and weights <span class="math inline">\(w:E\to \Z_+\)</span> and a budget <span class="math inline">\(B\in \Z_+\)</span>, find the edge set <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(c(R)\leq B\)</span> and that minimizes the <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>-weighted min cut in <span class="math inline">\((V,E\setminus R)\)</span>.

<p></p>
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17008v1">Fault-Tolerant Path</a>
problem (FTP) seems sililar to <a href="#prob3" title="Problem 3">Problem 3</a>. In FTP problem, we are given a
edge-weighted directed graph <span class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span>, a subset <span class="math inline">\(U \subseteq E\)</span> of vulnerable edges, two
vertices <span class="math inline">\(s,t\in V\)</span> and integers
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>. The task is to decide whether there
exists a subgraph <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with total cost at most <span class="math inline">\(ℓ\)</span> such that, after the removal of any
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vulnerable edges, <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> still contains an <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-path. The problem degenerates into
finding <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-edge connected spanning
subgraph if the set of vulnerable edges is <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.
<p></p>
A recent paper <span class="citation" data-cites="vygen_fptas_2024">[<a href="#ref-vygen_fptas_2024" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span> gives an
FPTAS for the problem. Here I try to develop the intuition since I have
never seen an algorithm based on reweighting edges this complicated and
ingenious.
<p></p>
First one can see that the optimal solution can always be a subset of
edges in a cut of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. This is
because if the optimal solution <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span>
contains any edge not in the cut, we can safely delete it from <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span>. Thus the optimal solution is indeed
a pair <span class="math inline">\((C^*,R^*\subset C^*)\)</span>. The
authors call this problem the <em><span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-free min-cut problem</em> (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the budget and we are allowed to
pick edges for free in the “mincut” with total weight at most <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>).
<p></p>
So the goal is to find a FPTAS for the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-free mincut problem. The problem is
hard since it contains knapsack as a special case. (Consider a graph
with many parallel edges and only 2 vertices.) However, it is known that
there is a <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15854-f05/www/scribe/lec10.pdf">FPTAS
for knapsack</a>. If we know part of the optimal solution, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span>, we can use the FPTAS for knapsack to
find the optimal <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span>.
<p></p>
At this stage, if there is a hint suggesting reweighting the edges, I
would guess that <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span> is exactly (or
close to) the min-cut of the re-weighted graph. Based on this idea I
would also guess that, although the connectivity interdiction problem
(<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>-free min-cut) is NP-hard, <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span> can be computed in polynomial time.
In other words, the intractable part is solving the knapsack in <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span>. This statement seems reasonable,
since this problem is know to be in P for unit costs and in that case
the kanpsack is trivial. Let’s assume that my guess is correct and work
on the reweighting part.
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="reweighting"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Reweighting</h2>
<p></p>
There is a <a href="https://sarielhp.org/teach/notes/aprx/lec/18_reweight.pdf">chapter
on reweighting</a> in Sariel Har-Peled’s gemetric approximation book(not
quite the same as the reweighting technique in <span class="citation" data-cites="vygen_fptas_2024">[<a href="#ref-vygen_fptas_2024" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>). Is reweighting a common technique
for designing approximation algorithms?
<p></p>
One possible weight function is setting <span class="math inline">\(w(e)=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(e\in R^*\)</span>… However, this is cheating since
we assume that <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span> is the hard
part. So now we need to find a weight function such that the following
holds,
<ol type="1">
<li>The min-cut of the re-weighted graph is close to <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span>.</li>
<li>Computing the weight function takes polynomial time.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
From the “cheating” example we can see that knowing <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span> does help but computing <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span> is hard. So maybe we can find a
slightly worse weight function which is a lot easier to compute. So it
seems like we are making a trade-off between how close the global
min-cut of the re-weighted graph is to <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span>, and how much time is needed to
compute this weight function. This paper indeed does a great job in
finding such a balance. I sent an email to one of the authors to ask for
the intuition behind the reweighting but did not get a real answer. They
suggested reading <span class="citation" data-cites="zenklusen_connectivity_2014">[<a href="#ref-zenklusen_connectivity_2014" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>. Zenklusen did almost the same
thought experiment as above. Instead of using reweighting, he indirectly
enumerated <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span>. Consider the unit
cost case for example. If the optimal cut <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span> is given, the interdicted edges <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span> will be those <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> edges in <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span> with heaviest weights. We cannot
directly enumerate <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span> since it
still takes exponential time. What we can enumerate is a lowerbound of
the weight of edges in <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span>. Set all
edges with weights exceeding this lowerbound to be in <span class="math inline">\(R^*\)</span> and find global min-cut with
additional budget constraint on these edges. Then we have only <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> lowerbound to enumerate and the
budgeted min-cut can be computed fast. For general costs, he enumerated
the set of <span class="math inline">\({1}/{\varepsilon}\)</span> edges
with heaviest weights in <span class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span>.
<p></p>
The plan is to figure out how did the authors come up with the weight
function in <span class="citation" data-cites="vygen_fptas_2024">[<a href="#ref-vygen_fptas_2024" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span> and if
it is possible to find a better weight function.
<p></p>
The key part is the following new problem called normilized min-cut,
<div id="normmincut" class="theorem-environment Problem" data-index="4" type="Problem" title="Normalized min-cut">
<span class="theorem-header"><span class="type">Problem</span><span class="index">4</span><span class="name">Normalized
min-cut</span></span>
<p></p>
Given a problem instance of connectivity interdiction, find a cut <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and its subset <span class="math inline">\(F\subset C\)</span> s.t. <span class="math inline">\(0\leq c(F)\leq b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{w(C\setminus F)}{b+1-c(F)}\)</span> is
minimized.
</div>
<p></p>
<del>I have been thinking for a while how this problem is involved but
have no clue. However, it does work…</del> The weight function is
defined based on an estimation of <a href="#normmincut" title="Problem 4">Problem 4</a>. The authors claim that the optimal
solution to b-free min-cut problem is a 2-approximate min-cut of the
reweighted graph. Then they enumerate all 2-approximate min-cut of the
reweighted graph and use the FPTAS alg for knapsack on each cut to find
a <span class="math inline">\((1+\epsilon)\)</span>-approx solution.
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="more-on-normalized-min-cut"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> More on normalized min-cut</h2>
<p></p>
If one slightly modifies lemmas in section 2 in <span class="citation" data-cites="vygen_fptas_2024">[<a href="#ref-vygen_fptas_2024" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>, there are some interesting
properties. Let <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> be the value
of the optimal normalized min-cut (in <span class="citation" data-cites="vygen_fptas_2024">[<a href="#ref-vygen_fptas_2024" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is an estimation of the optimum) and
define <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{w}_\tau\)</span> accordingly.
Then one can prove that the global min cut in <span class="math inline">\((G,\tilde{w}_\tau)\)</span> is exactly the optimal
cut in the normalized min-cut of <span class="math inline">\((G,w)\)</span> (slightly modify lemma3 to see
this). Also the value of min-cut in <span class="math inline">\((G,\tilde{w}_\tau)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\tau(b+1)\)</span>.
<p></p>
For unit cost, the optimum of normalized min-cut can be computed using
the same complexity as connectivity interdiction (ignoring polylog
factors) <span class="citation" data-cites="chalermsook_approximating_2022">[<a href="#ref-chalermsook_approximating_2022" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>. Consider the sequence <span class="math inline">\(\set{\lambda_i=\frac{\min_{|F|\le i} w(C\setminus

interdiction algorithm should be sufficient. (Note that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is at most <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> since costs are unit.) However, one can
easily see that this sequence is not unimodal. Thus I don’t quite
believe this claim.

After reading <span class="citation" data-cites="chalermsook_approximating_2022">[<a href="#ref-chalermsook_approximating_2022" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>, I finally know why the authors use
<a href="#normmincut" title="Problem 4">Problem 4</a> to solve
connectivity interdiction. Almost all techniques they used are directly
from <span class="citation" data-cites="chalermsook_approximating_2022">[<a href="#ref-chalermsook_approximating_2022" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>. Read section 2 of <span class="citation" data-cites="chalermsook_approximating_2022">[<a href="#ref-chalermsook_approximating_2022" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> until 2.2, you know almost everything
needed for a FPTAS solving connectivity interdiction. In fact, the
authors cite <span class="citation" data-cites="chalermsook_approximating_2022">[<a href="#ref-chalermsook_approximating_2022" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> in their paper,
<blockquote>
<p></p>
In a recent paper of Chalermsook et el. [CHN+22] on survivable network
design, the same problem was first introduced (under a diﬀerent name
“minimum normalized free cut”) to deal with a certain boxing constraint
in the LPs. There, a special case of unit-edge costs is actually solved
as a technical necessity. To obtain an FPTAS in this paper, we emphasize
that we do not need to solve the normalized min-cut problem per se, but
rather we use its optimal solution as a certificate in the analysis of
the weight function <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{w}(i)\)</span> in
Theorem 3.
</blockquote>
<p></p>
This paragraph is somewhat misleading. There is no clearly indication
that very similar (in fact, almost identical) results are proven
[CHN+22].
<!-- Not to mention that the authors were somewhat avoiding my question (in my opinion) about Normalized min-cut(see [reweighting part](#reweighting)). -->
<p></p>
It was mentioned in a footnote of <span class="citation" data-cites="chalermsook_approximating_2022">[<a href="#ref-chalermsook_approximating_2022" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> that a general version of normalized
min-cut is used in <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol064-isaac2016/LIPIcs.ISAAC.2016.33/LIPIcs.ISAAC.2016.33.pdf">this
paper</a>, which in turn mentioned that normalized min-cut is an
ordinary subroutine in MWU frameworks.
<!-- This IPCO paper's writing style is toxic and causes huge waste of readers' time. I do not think this paper still can be accepted by IPCO if reviewers and PCs notice its relation with [CHN+22]. -->
